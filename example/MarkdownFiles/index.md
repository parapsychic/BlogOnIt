<H1>Blackpink Is The Revolution</H1>
<p>Note from the author: </p>
<ul>
    <li>If you want a Table of Contents, you need to include the TOC marker (<code>%-%TOC%-%</code>). Example in Members/Lisa.md and it's corresponding page at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/Members/Lisa.html">Lisa</a></li>
    <li>Codeblocks might work, but can have varying effects.</li>
    <li>Math mode is not at all supported.</li>
    <li>My markdown knowledge is very basic and since each compiler has it's own quirks, I am not sure how to approach certain tasks. If you find any issues, raise an issue at <a href="https://github.com/parapsychic/BlogOnIt/issues/new">here</a>.</li>

<p>Here is a blog on why Blackpink is the best</p>
